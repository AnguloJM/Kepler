## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

#### MVP 

- Allow user to retrieve data, based on their search
- Bring back pictures realated to their search
- Have a button to hear sample music when retreiving music 

#### PostMVP  

- Have a recently searched tab
- create a filter button to narrow search
- Adjust app to also fit on mobile

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Pseudocode | H | 2hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| CSS Styling | H | 12hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| JS functionality | H | 8hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Post MVP work | H | 6hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| API functionality | H | 10hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Debugging | H | 2hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Total | H | 40hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
